Hello my GitHub family..

I came up with data insights of flipkart'data which chosen at random for only making dashboard.

🧾 1. Total Metrics Summary
Total Sales: ₹10 million
Average Sales per Transaction: ₹10.08K

📍 2. Sales Distribution by Region
Top Regions:
South: 21.32%
North: 21.01%
Lowest Region: West at 18.21%
